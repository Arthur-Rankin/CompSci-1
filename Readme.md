# Computer Science 1 Code Exercises & Workspace

## This is where I will keep track of exercises and practice programs for my Spring 2022 CompSci 1 Class. This course is the study of the history of computing, computer organization, computer applications, algorithm design, stepwise refinement of algorithms, structured programming using C++, array representation of data, processing of character data, text file processing, subprograms, and parameter passing.

### List of Programs

    - Use to calculate your 401k after n years. Follow the cout prompts. 
-Chapter 5: Loops and Files
    - outputLoop Program: 
        - Loops 10 times to print the numbers 1 - 10 to an `outputFile` Uses `<fstream>` header file to create a file called `numbers.txt`.
    - inputLoop Program: 
        - Reades the file created by outputLoop program and displays the information.
