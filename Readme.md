# Computer Science 1 Code Exercises & Workspace

## This is where I will keep track of exercises and practice programs for my Spring 2022 CompSci 1 Class. This course is the study of the history of computing, computer organization, computer applications, algorithm design, stepwise refinement of algorithms, structured programming using C++, array representation of data, processing of character data, text file processing, subprograms, and parameter passing.

### List of Programs
- 401k program: 
    - Use to calculate your 401k after n years. Follow the cout prompts. 
- Chapter 5: Loops and Files
    - outputLoop Program: 
        - Loops 10 times to print the numbers 1 - 10 to an `outputFile` Uses `<fstream>` header file to create a file called `numbers.txt`.
    - inputLoop Program: 
        - Reades the file created by outputLoop program and displays the information. I am careful to check to make sure that they file exists. The while loop checks to make sure that an item still exists to print out to the console.
- Chapter 6: Functions
    - evenOrOdd program 
        - simple program that checks to see if a number given by the user is even or odd and then tells the user which it is. 
- Chapter 7: Arrays and Vectors
    - funcsLoopsAndArrays program:
        - a program that has three functions that all have their own type of array. 
    - numericArray program:
        - performing sum, average, highest, and lowest algorithms on numeric arrays
    - displayArray7 program:
        - programs that has a function that should accepts a 2D array and displays its contents on the screen. The function also works for any 2D array with 7 columns.
